### Sugarlabs/musicblocks (First priority)
- im in their community and interact with them in the channel
- i have raised 2 PRs in musiblocks(merged) and 2 PRs in musicblocks-git-backend(not merged, open)
- i have selected musicblocks-git-backend from the idea list for this summer
- also actively reviewing some PRs in musicblocks
- my goal for feb is to fix all the medium console cleanups from musicblocks and raise a PR in musicblocks-git-backend introducing new CI workflow for jest-tests
- and review as many PRs as i can from both the repos

### Gemini CLI (Second priority)
