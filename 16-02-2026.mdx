# am I doing enough?

so this question always structs me. Am I really doing enough. Should I be doing more?
I have started taking things seriously now. I have a purpose. I am gradually increasing my time learning and building projects. I love exploring new things, so today I scrolled through HN and found this amazing os vector database from alibaba. It's super fast I was reading through their documentation. Also I was wondering how is an embedding model made. Then i learned on how to write good error handling and how it is written in big projects which run in production. I raised a .small pr on music blocks. I am thinking of raising an issue 2morrow on writing a custom debugger that will help clean things. As currently we are straight up removing logs but some logs maybe imp, so a lightweight Debugger class might come in handy that will only run in production environment. And for the musicblocos git backend i will raise issue for a global error handler but before that I need to see how error is currently handled in all the files. This might take a day not more than that. Then raise a meaningful issue with a draft pr.
